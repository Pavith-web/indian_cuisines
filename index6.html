    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Chhattisgarh is a state in the central part of India. The word ‘Chhattis’ means thirty-six and ‘Garh’ means fort, so the name Chhattisgarh symbolizes the number of forts in the region. It is also known as the ‘Rice Bowl’ of Central India, and nearly 70% of its population is engaged in agriculture. Paddy is the principal crop of the state  which also constitutes the main diet of people here. It is evident that with increase in urbanization there is a change from traditional eating behaviour of people towards the fast-food culture.</p>
    <p>Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angakar Roti</li>
        <li>Chausela</li>
        <li>Cheela</li>
        <li>Dhuska Dhuska</li>
        <li>Fara</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ANGAKAR ROTI</h2>
    <p> Angakar Roti - It is a thick flatbread (Roti) made of rice flour and is cooked over burning charcoal. Angar is burning charcoal, and because of this cooking method, it derives the name ‘Angakar Roti’ (shown in Fig. 1). Alternatively, wheat (Triticum aestivum) flour is also used to prepare it and is a common dish in many northern states of India. In southern states Akki Roti is popular which is cooked on hot griddle (tawa) after smearing oil on it.</p>

    <h2>CHEELA</h2>

It can also be prepared with flour of Moong (green gram) or Urad (black gram) or Besan (Bengal gram) flour. It seems similar to the Dosa of South India and is often called Chhattisgarhi Dosa. Dosa is a fermented product prepared from rice and black gram batter [20], whereas Cheela is prepared without fermentation. Usually, it is consumed in the morning with spicy Chutney.</p>

    <h2>FARA</h2>
    <p>Faraa - Faraa is a steamed rice preparation (shown in Fig. 5). Rice flour is mixed with warm water and a pinch of salt to prepare the dough. Soaked black gram or green gram paste mixed with spices such as ginger, coriander, cumin, black pepper, turmeric can be used as stuffing. It can be made without the stuffing as well. For steam cooking, first heat 2 to 3 cups of water in a vessel, place a strainer over it and grease it with a little oil or ghee. Place some Faraa over the strainer and cook for 10 to 12 min on medium flame while covering it. It is an oil free and delicious food. To make it spicy and little crispy, Faraa can also be fried in a little oil along with mustard seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, ginger, garlic and green chilli.</p>
