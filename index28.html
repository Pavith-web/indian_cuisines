    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>The cuisine of Uttar Pradesh is just as diverse as its geography. Ranging from every day classics like sabziyon ki tehari to a princely lakhnavi spread, this diverse state nestles the most exotic recipes in its kitty. Delectable delicacies like chaat, samosa and pakora, that top the most popular street food charts in all of India, are native to this state. State cuisines from Uttar Pradesh have absorbed and adapted a variety of dishes to create an entire smorgasbord of authentic recipes.
        The state is famous for its royally delicious Nawabi food. Cooking techniques in Uttar Pradesh were greatly influenced by Mughal's. The cuisine of northern Uttar Pradesh is very different from the classic Mughlai food of Delhi. The Nawabs of Oudh were great gourmets and encouraged their master chefs to create new culinary styles. The famous recipes of Lucknow are 'tunda kebabs' and 'kakori kebabs'  flavored with rich spices and seeds.
        The main genre of Uttar Pradesh cuisine is Awadhi, and the cooking patterns of the state are similar to those of the rest of Northern India. The Awadhi cuisine of Uttar Pradesh bears similarities to those of Kashmir and Punjab.
