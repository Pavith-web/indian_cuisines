    <h2>SEKINALU</h2>
    <p>Who doesn’t love some crispy, deep-fried snack every now and then? Sakinalu is one of those grubs that Indians have been perfecting over the years in various parts of India and giving it different names like murkku, chakli etc. But Sakinalu is not the same as the aforementioned items although they do share a slightly similar preparation. Its two chief ingredients are rice and sesame seeds and is devoid of spices, therefore making it a mild snack that is also easy to prepare. It is mainly made during the festival of Sankranti or is offered during marriage.

    <h2>PACHI PULUSU</h2>
    <p>A quick fix for that morning where you’re too sick to cook or you’re craving for Rasam but you are lazy to carry out the entire process of making; Pachi Pulusu will come to your rescue. So the basic difference between Pachi Pulusu and Rasam is that the former has very little “cooking” involved and uses the gas only to temper the seasoning. The commonality is their ingredients. While tamarind requires to be boiled for rasam, it only needs to be soaked in lukewarm water for this dish. The simplicity of the dish sure helps our lazy selves to have wholesome food once in while!</p>
