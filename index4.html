    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Assamese cuisine is full of character. Cooking techniques include that of hills as well as plains, so there is a heady mix of fermented food and fresh produce. By now you are probably thinking about pork with bamboo shoot, and why not? This dish, not only in Assam, but popular in most northeastern states of India, has topped the food popularity chart and continue to be a favourite of many all over India. In Assam, they love it just tad bit more than anywhere else in India. But it would be a travesty to only identify Assamese cuisine with the said pork and bamboo shoot. Their traditional meal made of khar (banana peel's ash extract), dishes with elephant apples and fiddlehead fern, or be it the simple doi-chira, a Bihu specialityâ€”Assamese food is unique (and delicious!) </p>
    <p>Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Omita Khar</li>
        <li>Masor Tenga</li>
        <li>Duck with Kumura</li>
        <li>Dhekia Xaak</li>
        <li>Pani Hamuk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OMITA KHAR</h2>
    <p>Khar is banana peel's ash extract and is similar to sodium bicarbonate. This is traditional Assamese dish made of young raw papaya. Khar gives the already aromatic papaya, a sweet aroma that I believe adds more to the taste.</p>

    <h2>MASOR TENGA</h2>
    <p>Great for summer, this dish is made of fish and slices of dried mangosteen. In the absence of dried mangosteen, the dish can also be made with Kazi nimbu (a family of kaffir lime). This dish is light, perfect for summer time and a favourite among all Assamese communities.</p>

    <h2>DUCK WITH KUMURA</h2>
    <p>Locally called "haa", duck is one of the most popular meats consumed by Assamese folks. White gourd is the choice ingredient because its natural aroma complements the duck. This dish is usually heavily spiced, but delicious nonetheless. This is a must-have.</p>

    <h2>DHEKIA XAAK</h2>
    <p>This is fiddlehead fern. A vegetable commonly eaten in the hilly regions of India. Dhekia Xaak (pronounced as haak) is a sign of spring's arrival. The Assamese folks love their dhekia, they like to cook it with tomatoes, dried shrimps, dried mangosteen or just a simple stir fry!</p>

    <h2>PANI HAMUK</h2>
    <p>For the uninitiated ones, this dish would be something of a challenge. Pani hamuk, translated as water snails, when sourced from paddy field or clean flowing river/streams, taste great. A bit of a challenge because one needs to suck the meat out of the shell. Water snails cooked with pumpkin or potatoes (with pork and fermented beans in Nagaland) are as exotic as they come.</p>
