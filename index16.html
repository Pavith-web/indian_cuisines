    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p> The North-Eastern states, or the seven sisters, as they are more famously known, are hotbeds of beauty. No, they are not just beautiful because of the sprawling tea gardens!. There is so much more that these unexplored states hold in store for tourists. One of these states is Manipur. It has been dubbed “the Jewelled Land” due to its natural beauty. It is the birthplace of the Ras Lila, the classical Manipuri dance. Apart from that, Manipur is also well known for its delicious cuisine.
        The food of Manipur is considered to be very healthy. Their preparations are simple and yet, tasty. Most of the ingredients they use are organic which again, contributes to the health factor. Of course, the food here has to be healthy, as there are so many hills and peaks in this area that require a good deal of strength and agility to scale! Manipuri food is also supposed to be spicy and contains less oil. Their secret is that they make use of chilli pepper instead of the usual garam masala powder that the rest of the country uses. That is why their food is considered healthier.</p>
    <p>Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chamthong</li>
        <li>Eromba</li>
        <li>Morok Metpa</li>
        <li>Singju</li>
